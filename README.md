# Link-Scanner-AI

A bot that gets links and scans them using Virustotal's API. The links are obtained via Discord, useful for big community servers that have a lot of links being posted there. 
You may add words to veto so when the bot encounters that word in a link, it won't scan it. The method used it not in any means foolproof, it won't stop people altering their 
links by adding vetoed keywords.
